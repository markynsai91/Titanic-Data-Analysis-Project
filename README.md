# Titanic-Data-Analysis-Project


## Project Summary
This project explores the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster using data analysis and visualization in Python. The analysis focused on understanding how passenger class and age affected survival outcomes to draw insights that could inform fairer ship design and emergency planning. I cleaned and prepared the dataset using Pandas, handled missing values with mean imputation, and created an age_category column to group passengers into Children (0–14), Youth & Adults (15–64), and Seniors (65+). Visualizations were built to compare survival counts and rates across passenger classes and age groups. The findings showed a clear class-based disparity in survival rates, with first-class passengers having significantly higher survival chances. Children had a higher likelihood of survival compared to adults and seniors, revealing patterns of vulnerability that could inform better safety design in future maritime planning. Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook, Excel

## Project Goals

Goal:See if survival rate had anything to do with the passenger class, Also assess the age of the passengers within each class to identify vulnerable age categories.
